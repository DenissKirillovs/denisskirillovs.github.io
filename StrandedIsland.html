								This is a project I worked on during my first year at University for a "Level Design 
								Fundamentals" unit. I needed to create a relatively small level environment using one of the asset packs provided
								to us, and create a video showcasing the level in its form using Unreal Engine Sequencer tool.
							</p>
							<p>
								I went through many different ideas of an environment that I wanted to create, 
								however in the end I settled for a human inhabited island with a medieval docking port, 
								with a medieval architecture.
							</p>
							<p>
								For this project I used <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/medieval-docks">medieval docks asset pack</a> 
								alongside a <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/fantasy-and-medieval-artchitecture-kit">medieval architecture kit asset pack</a>

							<p>
								This is a project I worked on for roughly around 2 weeks - I first began creating a whiteboxed
								environment to get a feel for the scale and the environment I wanted to create. After I got the desired
								look I began working on a procedural landscape material.
							</p>
							<p>
								The medieval architecture pack came with fully modular buildings assets that was very easy to use and design
								unique buildings, on top of various props that were used to populate the scene and make it seem full and realistic.
							</p>

								<img src = "images\MedievalArchitecture_MyModularBuilding.png" style="max-width: 90%;"><br><br>
							</div>

							<p>
								After designing some unique modular houses, I began plotting creating the main part of the level, which was the port.
								<br>
								I used some reference images and artwork of online of medeival ports and used those images as inspiration.
							</p>

							<h3>Something to note:</h3>
							<p>
								One thing that was very limiting is the fact that my computer wasn't really fit for this type
								of work at the time. So the visual quality of the models, environment and especially the grass is very lacking.
								<br>
								This is something that I wholeheartedly regret overlooking before starting this project. In hindsight,
								it was probably more plausible to create a different environment in a different setting than an open plan level.
							</p>
							<p>
								Due to this project basically being one of my first ever environments I created, a lot of things were never even considered or implemented.
								Things such as a post-process material, atmoshperic fog and proper lighting was something that I never really explored and experienced designing with.
