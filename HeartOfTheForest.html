                                Heart of the Forest is a vertical-slice-demo project I was part of as a generalist game 
                                designer during my 2nd year at Bournemouth University. 
                                The project consisted of 5 team members:
							</p>
							<p> - Producer</p>
							<p> - Lead programmer</p>

                                Heart of the Forest is a 3D action wave defence game.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The main game mechanic features a day and night cycle where a time-gated peace period is enabled during 
                                the day, allowing the player to purchase upgrades. During the night cycle, a wave of enemies spawns from within
                                the forest surrounding the village, which the player is tasked to defend.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There is a 1-minute time frame between each wave, allowing you to purchase 
                                upgrades for both your village and yourself before the fight.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Each building has health points and upon reaching 0 it will be destroyed. The buildings can be repaired 
                                after the wave has been cleared. However the centre core of the village is the heart and soul and when 
                                destroyed by the enemies, the game will end.

							<h2>My Role</h2>
							<h3>Game Design</h3>
							<p>
                                I worked alongside my lead designer to create a Game Design Document (GDD), outlining the game's 
                                core concepts. My role as a game designer involved shaping gameplay mechanics, 
                                player progression, and level design.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our creative freedom was restricted due to time limitations and uncooperative programmers. 
                                We wanted unique attacks and strategic gameplay, but the programming team was not as 
                                receptive to that idea as we were. This resulted in basic combat mechanics and underdeveloped AI, 
                                impacting the overall game experience.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Despite these challenges, we focused on working within the given constraints to deliver a 
                                "Vertical Slice Demo" – a representative sample of the game. While the combat and AI didn't meet our 
                                ideal vision due to the limitations, the demo showcased our efforts within feasible bounds.
                            </p>
                            <h3>3D Modelling and Design</h3>
                            <p>
                                I produced initial drafts and concept art outlining the environment, levels, and 
                                overall design of the playable game area. Once these concepts gained approval from the lead designer and producer, 
                                I transitioned into crafting 3D Models utilizing Maya and Substance Painter.
                            <p>
                                My task involved crafting three distinct building types, each with its own set of three upgrade tiers. 
                                It was essential for these buildings to stand apart both within their own tier and from each other. 
                                Given the project's specifications, I opted for a simplified, low-poly aesthetic for the models.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Particle Effects</h3>
                            <p>
                                On top of general modelling and designing, I took charge of creating particle effects for the player,
                                enemies, and buildings.
                                These were extremely simple in design due to the art style the game was following.
