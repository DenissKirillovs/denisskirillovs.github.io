                                Exclusion Zone is a project I developed as part of my final year project at Bournemouth University. 
                                This was mostly a solo development project, with weekly meetings 
                                with my university supervisors throughout the pre-production and production stages.
								<br><br>
                                For my final year study, I wanted to explore techniques used in games to create an immersive horror atmosphere using
                                sound, level design and game systems.
								<br><br>
								I developed a Game Design Document (GDD) in conjunction with a dissertation paper. 
								This dissertation incorporated a mix of academic and professional research, sourced from a variety of books, papers, and blog posts. 
								Through an in-depth analysis of over 30 research sources, 
								I identified key elements that greatly contributed to the creation of my immersive horror atmosphere.

							<p>
								The game is a first-person atmospheric horror game. 
								It was designed from the ground-up to be an environment design project, however it later on turned to become a short playable level.
							</p>
							<p>
								During my planning and mockup stage, I've used various tools such as Figma, Trello and Photoshop
								 to plan out what I wanted to create.
							</p>
							<p>
								<a href="https://trello.com" class="URL-Link">Trello</a> was used frequently to manage the development of the project and help me manage tasks, 
								bugs and fixes that needed to be done - both pre-production and during production.

							<p>
								Photoshop and <a href="https://www.figma.com/" class="URL-Link">Figma</a> were used alongside to sketch, and dot down all the 
								important information about the project and brainstorm key ideas about the games systems and design.
							</p>
							<p>
								Due to the time restraints of this project, I've decided to use an 
								<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/abandoned-russian-building" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"  class="URL-Link">asset pack</a> from the Unreal Engine Marketplace 
								to speed up the development process.

                            I first began by designing a quick top down mock-up of the level. The design went through various iterations
                            and it was settled on the one that fit the asset pack I was using. Since this was an atmospheric environment project,
                            it was crucial to employ various level design techniques such as long hallways, lack of lighting in certain areas, etc
                            for this type of game.

							<h2>Blocking out stage</h2>
							<p>
								The development began with a whitebox level in Unreal Engine. The purpose of this whitebox was to create the general
								layout and get a feel of the environment before I fully commited into the development.
							</p>
							<p>
								Once the general shape of the whitebox was created, I started developing a more thorough and detailed
								version of the level.

							</div>


							<h2>VHS Effect</h2>
							<p>
								This VHS effect was made to mimic old film tapes you'd see in 20th-century films. 
                                The environment was set in the post-Chornobyl explosion event, 
                                evident by various landmarks and hints about it in the environment. 
							</p><br>

									<source src="ExclusionZone_VHS_Showcase.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>
							</div><br>
							<p>
                                I achieved this by setting up a post-processing material and applying it to the player camera. 
                                The material had various variables that can be changed on the go, 
                                such as the frequency of the static in the lower part of the screen.
                                Things like changing the saturation, brightness etc was also possible, 
                                which made setting up the tone and mood of the environment much easier.

							<h2>Flashlight</h2>
							<p>
                                A flashlight, although simple, was the most crucial part to add for the player. 
                                It was the only source of light that the player has full control of, 
                                and adding slight dimness and a small light radius helped build that scary tone I wanted to create.
                                Additionally, camera lag was implemented in both the player camera itself and the flashlight, 
                                which added smooth, realistic camera movement.

								<video width="640" height="360" loop autoplay muted>
									<source src="ExclusionZoneFlashlightShowcase.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video>
							</div><br>

							<h2>Lighting</h2>
							<p>
								Due to the moon's natural lighting intensity being too dark for the scene after the light
								has been baked. The solution to creating good lighting for the scene was to create artificial 
								lights around the windows that are facing the moon. This made the environment more realistic
								and immersive which contributed to the overall experience.
							</p>
							<div class = "ProjectImages">
								<img src = "images\ExclusionZone_FakeLighting.png" width ="95%" height = "450px"><br><br>
							</div>

							<h2>Main Menu</h2>
							<p>
								Although this is not really gameplay related, however, upon launching the game,
                                you can see different perspectives of the level when you are in the main menu. This 
                                element was created to give a slight introduction to the game and try to immerse the player
                                before they set foot into the environment.

							<h2>Evaluation</h2>
							<p>
								For this project, I performed a user study utilising an online questionnaire to collect and assess 
                                participants' data. The study was aimed to collect user experience and feelings during and after they have
                                played a demo version of the game.
							</p>
							<p>
                                The study was performed using Google Forms and a total of 10 individuals participated in the study. I used
                                qualitative data coding to categorise their responses to find any relevant themes and patterns - which I then used
                                to analyse and give a verdict on whether the project achieved its goal of creating an immersive horror atmosphere.
							</p>
							<h2>Results</h2>
							<p>
                                Overall the participant feedback was mostly positive, with many participants expressing their enjoyment. 
								Many responses were mentioning good use of lighting and graphic quality and how it enhanced their experience. And the vast majority
                                complimented the particular use of different sound effects and ambient noise.
							</p>
							<p>
                                On the other hand, some people expressed the lack of accessibility and compatibility with games using
                                foreign keyboards and the inability of changing screen options such as the VHS effects.
							</p>
							<h2>Feedforward</h2>
							<p>
                                The feedback provided great insight into the things that the game was lacking, in the future it is important
                                to accommodate players with different nationality keyboards, give more options and settings to work with and 
                                tailor more towards the user experience and satisfaction.
