								Exclusion Zone is a project I developed as part of my final year project in Bournemouth University. 
								This was mostly a solo development project, with weekly meetings 
								with my university supervisors throughout the pre-production and production stages.
								<br>
								A GDD (Game Design Document) was developed alongside a dissertation paper containing academic and 
								professional research on various techniques in creating engaging and immersive environments in the horror genre - 
								which was the focus of my project.
								<br><br>
								Due to the time restriction of this project, I've decided to use an <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/abandoned-russian-building" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asset pack</a> from the Unreal Engine Marketplace.

								The game is a first-person atmospheric horror game. 
								It was designed from the ground-up to be an environment design project, however it later on turned to become a short playable level.
								The game consists of various mechanics and systems that were implemented with the aim to aid the horror theme of the environment. 
							</p>
							<div>
								<p>During my planning and mockup stage, I've used various tools such as Figma, Trello and Photoshop,
								 to plan out what I wanted to create. </p>
								<p>
									Trello was used frequently to manage the development of the project and help me manage tasks, 
									bugs and fixes that needed to be done.

							<h2>VHS Effect</h2>
							<p>This VHS effect was made to mimic old film tapes you'd see in the 20th century films. 
								The environment was set in the post-chernobyl explosion event, 
								evident by various landmarks and hints about it in the environment. 
							</p><br>

							<p>
								I achieved this by setting up a post-processing material and applying it to the player camera. 
								The material had various variables that can be changed on the go, 
								such as frequence of the static in the lower part of the screen. 
								Things like changing the saturation, brightness etc was also possible, 
								which made setting up the tone and mood of the environment much more easier.
							</p><br>

							<h2>Flashlight</h2>
							<p>A flashlight, although simple, was the most crucial part to add for the player. 
								It was the only source of light that the player has full control of, 
								and by adding slight dimness and small light radius helped build that scary tone I wanted to create.
								Additionally, camera lag was implemented to both the camera itself and the flashlight, which added this nice,
								smooth camera.

							<h2>Main Menu</h2>
							<p>Although this is not really gameplay related, however, upon launching the game,
								you can see different perspectives of the level when you are in the main menu. This 
								element was created to give the slight introduction to the game and try to immerse the player.
